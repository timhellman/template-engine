This is Tim Hellman's homework assignment for Unit 10, Object-Oriented Programming.

## USER STORY

With this application, a user has the ability to create a roster of all the members of an engineering team by answering the command line prompts.  Following the prompts, the user can enter a team member's role, name, id, email address, and property specific to that team member's role.  Once the user has entered all the necessary information, the employee roster will be neatly displayed on the team html page in the output folder.
